<p>
	Slate is a light weight IDE for Scala developers. It is absolutely open source and open to suggestions. The code is hosted at <A href="https://github.com/asinghal/SlateIDE">Github</A>.
	<br><br>
	Slate was created as the existing IDE support for Scala had large memory footprint and were not, in the author's opinion, sufficiently productive. The intention with this IDE is that basic Scala support be provided to enable maximum performance of the IDE and productivity of the developer. 
	<br><br>
	<b>Credits: </b>Slate has been written using some Java Swing components from ScalaConsole, an open source project. The functional inspiration has been taken from Eclipse, of which I am a great fan.
